   After my masters, I was in search of the best possible traineeship to boost my career in IT. However, choosing the right opportunity was quite a challenge in a market saturated with so many traineeship offerings. Upon carefully checking the possibilities in the market, I soon came to the conclusion that Devoteam by far offered the best in-depth track in the field of IT. Currently, five months later, I have successfully completed the extensive training schedule and just been appointed my first assignment as a DevOps Engineer.
